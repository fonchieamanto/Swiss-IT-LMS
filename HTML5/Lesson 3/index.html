    <h1>Egyptians</h1>
    <p>We call the <b>Egyptians </b>accent because they lived such a long time ago â€“ not
        because they all reached a ripe old age! The first
        Egyptians were farmers about 8,000 years ago.
        Within a few thousand years, Egypt had become
        one of the most powerful countries in the world.
